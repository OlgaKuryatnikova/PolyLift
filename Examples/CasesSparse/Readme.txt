Cases used to test the sparse certificates on compact sets in the paper. 
Each case has the following data inside: number of variables numVars, degree of the objective degf, objective function structure f that constains the objective coefficients and monomial matrix, the set of constraints gg (in >=0 format), rng seed used to generate the case. 
The numbers in the case names indicate the number of variables, the degree of the objective, and the seed.
